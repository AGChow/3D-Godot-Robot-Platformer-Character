# 3D-Godot-Robot-Platformer-Character
Robot character rigged and animated for Godot 3d prototyping

A lot of these animations are single frame animations that are really useful if used with Godot's interpolation

The crouch is very useful if used between a fall and an idle pose for example.

Though limited, these animations will help anyone get started in Godot 3D
