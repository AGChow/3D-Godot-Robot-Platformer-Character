# 3D-Godot-Robot-Platformer-Character
Robot character rigged and animated for Godot 3d prototyping

A lot of these animations are single frame animations that are really useful if used with Godot's interpolation

The crouch is very useful if used between a fall and an idle pose for example.

Though limited, these animations will help anyone get started in Godot 3D

Included with the file should be
1 - Godot Robot GLTF/GLB file
2 - 4 alternate palettes
3 - 20 different animations!

All animations can be previewed here

NOTE: the wall jump and wall slide face different directions. This should be taken into account when implementing. This is because games often require players to point towards the wall when wall sliding, but when jumping away from the wall, the player will quickly turn away from the wall and snap in the opposite direction and the animations reflect this use case.
